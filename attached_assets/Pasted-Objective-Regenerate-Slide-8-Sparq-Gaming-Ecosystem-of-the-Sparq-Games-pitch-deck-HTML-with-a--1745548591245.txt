Objective: Regenerate Slide 8 ("Sparq Gaming Ecosystem™") of the Sparq Games pitch deck HTML with a completely new, more dynamic layout to increase visual impact and align better with the design document (sparq_deck_design_doc_v2) and INK Games inspiration. Replace the previous version of Slide 8 entirely.

Target: Slide 8 ("Sparq Gaming Ecosystem™") of the HTML pitch deck.

Specific Instructions for New Layout:

Overall Structure: Implement a two-section vertical layout (e.g., Left section ~55-60% width, Right section ~45-40% width).

Background: Apply a subtle dynamic background (e.g., Carbon to Grit Teal gradient, or Background2.jpg/Background3.jpg with an 80-90% dark overlay like Carbon). Ensure text readability.

Left Section (Text Content):

Place the main title "Sparq Gaming Ecosystem™" (ADAM.CG PRO, Large, Grit Teal) and subtitle "Crossing the Chasm to Web3" (Inter, Medium, White) at the top of this section.

Below the titles, add the main descriptive paragraphs ("We're crossing the chasm...", "Sparq develops..."). Use Inter font, White, ensuring readability.

Format the list of three core strategies ("Building large-scale...", "Seamlessly transitioning...", "Creating enhanced...") using Logo_Skull(Red).png as the primary bullet icon (small size). Use standard nested bullets (disc/square) for the sub-points under each main point. Ensure correct indentation.

Right Section (Visual Flow Diagram & Logo):

Create a visually distinct flow diagram showing the progression: Web2 -> Locker Room -> Web3.

Use three clearly defined shapes/containers (e.g., rounded rectangles with Grit Teal borders or Steel backgrounds) for:

"Web2 Games (Mass Appeal)" + Simple Controller Icon

"Sparq Locker Room™ (Bridge)" + Simple Locker/Bridge Icon

"Web3 Rewards/Collectibles" + Simple Token/Trophy Icon

Arrange these blocks vertically or slightly offset.

Connect the blocks with prominent, stylized arrows (e.g., thicker, Outlaw Red or Grit Teal color) indicating the flow direction.

Place the NCAA_Logo2.png clearly within this right section, likely below the diagram. Size appropriately (e.g., 60-80px height).

Typography: Strictly adhere to the font rules: ADAM.CG PRO (Main Title), Neodex (Optional Accent Headings - maybe for diagram block titles if desired), Inter (All body text, subtitles, diagram labels).

Color: Actively use Outlaw Red and Grit Teal for titles, icons, arrows, and container accents against the dark background.

Spacing & Polish: Ensure adequate padding within the slide and sections. Align elements cleanly. Ensure the Sparq Skull footer logo is present in the bottom-left.

Content Fit: Ensure all text content from Updated_Pitch_Deck_Content.txt for Slide 8 is included and fully visible without overflow. Adjust font sizes (Inter body text, min 12px) or spacing slightly if necessary.

Reference: This new layout should feel more structured and visually engaging, drawing inspiration from the INK Games deck's use of diagrams and visual blocks, while adhering to the specifics in sparq_deck_design_doc_v2. Replace the existing Slide 8 code.
