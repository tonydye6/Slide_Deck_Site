Objective: Refine the design of Slide 3 ("Web3 Simplified") in the existing Sparq Games pitch deck HTML, prioritizing fitting all content without overflow while improving visual structure and alignment with the design document (sparq_deck_design_doc_v2).Target: Slide 3 ("Web3 Simplified") of the HTML pitch deck.Specific Refinement Instructions (with Overflow Prevention):Layout & Structure:Implement a 3-column layout for the Web 1, Web 2, and Web 3 comparison.Crucially: Use flexible column widths (e.g., percentages or flexbox/grid properties that allow wrapping/shrinking) rather than fixed widths. Ensure the total width fits within the slide's main content area (considering slide padding).Apply a subtle visual distinction to each column (e.g., a very light background shade like Steel #1E1E24 on Carbon #2B2842, or a thin border in Grit Teal #00A19C). Avoid large padding inside these columns if it causes overflow.Ensure the market context paragraphs at the bottom are clearly separated from the columns above. If horizontal space is tight, stack this section fully below the columns rather than trying to place it partially alongside.Typography & Hierarchy:Increase the size of the main "Web3 Simplified" title (ADAM.CG PRO, Grit Teal), but ensure it doesn't cause layout shifts.Use ADAM.CG PRO or Neodex for the "Web 1", "Web 2", "Web 3" column headings, making them stand out (consider Outlaw Red or Grit Teal).Use Inter font for all descriptive text and market context paragraphs. If content overflows, reduce the font size for this body text (minimum 12px) as needed to make it fit. Prioritize fitting content over maintaining the initial suggested font size. Ensure text wraps within columns.Visual Elements & Icons:Add simple, distinct line icons ("Read", "Read-Write", "Read-Write-Own") above the respective column headings. Use Grit Teal or White. Keep icon sizes reasonable to save space.Add visual arrow elements (e.g., ->) in Outlaw Red between the columns. Make them subtle and ensure they don't disrupt the layout flow or cause width issues.Ensure Logo_Skull(Red).png is used for bullet points (small size).Color & Background:Apply brand colors as specified (headings, borders, icons, arrows).Consider a subtle background gradient or low-opacity tech pattern, ensuring it doesn't make text harder to read or contribute to visual clutter.Spacing & Polish:Prioritize content visibility. Use minimal necessary padding within column containers.Ensure consistent, but potentially reduced, margins between columns and text sections to maximize usable space.Check text alignment and icon positioning.Reference: Maintain consistency with the overall styles defined in sparq_deck_design_doc_v2, but adapt layout specifics (padding, font size, stacking) as needed to prevent any content from overflowing the slide boundaries.
