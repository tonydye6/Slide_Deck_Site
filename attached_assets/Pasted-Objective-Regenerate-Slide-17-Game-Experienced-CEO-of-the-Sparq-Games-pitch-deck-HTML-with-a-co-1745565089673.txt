Objective: Regenerate Slide 17 ("Game Experienced CEO") of the Sparq Games pitch deck HTML with a completely redesigned two-column layout focused on clear structure, better visual integration, and absolute prevention of content overflow. Replace the previous version of Slide 17 entirely.

Target: Slide 17 ("Game Experienced CEO") of the HTML pitch deck.

Specific Instructions for New Design:

Background: Use a clean, dark background (Carbon #2B2842 or Steel #1E1E24).

Layout: Implement a two-column layout (Left column ~30-35% width, Right column ~65-70% width). Ensure columns stack vertically on smaller screens.

Left Column (Images):

Place the primary headshot JanH_(Headshot).png prominently at the top.

Below the headshot, place the Jan_Nasdaq(Experienced_CEO_Slide).png image, scaled appropriately to fit neatly within this column. Consider applying a grayscale filter (filter: grayscale(100%);) or a subtle frame.

Right Column (Titles, Text, Logos, Character Image):

Place the main title "GAME EXPERIENCED CEO" (ADAM.CG PRO, Large, Uppercase, Grit Teal) and the name "JAN HORSFALL" (ADAM.CG PRO or Neodex, Medium-Large, White) at the top.

Structure the biographical text and associated visuals vertically below the titles:

Valvoline/Lycos Section: Display the relevant paragraph (Inter, Small-Medium, White). Place Valvoline_Logo.png (small) adjacent to or just below this text.

Turbine Section: Display the relevant paragraph (Inter, Use font size 13px-14px AND leading-snug line spacing). Create a small visual block below or adjacent containing Turbine_Logo.png (small) AND Lotro_Character.png (small, maybe opacity: 0.8).

CEO Roles Section: Display the relevant paragraph (Inter, Small-Medium, White). Below this text, create a compact grid (e.g., 4x2) displaying the logos (Gemini Voice, Novo, Gelazzi, Big Freeze, Universal, PetroChoice, Warner Bros, NorthWestern Energy - use text/generic if files unavailable). Keep logos small and uniform.

MIT Section: Display the relevant paragraph (Inter, Small-Medium, White). Place the MIT logo (text/generic) adjacent to this text.

Content Fit & Readability (CRITICAL):

Ensure ALL text content, images, and logos for Slide 17 are fully visible without overflowing or requiring scroll bars. This is the absolute top priority.

Use text wrapping extensively in the right column.

Mandatory: Use reduced font size (13px-14px) and tight line spacing (leading-snug) for the Inter description paragraphs, especially the Turbine section, as needed to fit. Minimum font size 12px.

Ensure high contrast between text and the dark background.

Typography & Color: Strictly adhere to the font rules (ADAM.CG PRO, Inter, Neodex accents) and Sparq color palette (Outlaw Red, Grit Teal, Carbon, Steel, White) as defined in the main design document (sparq_deck_design_doc_v2).

Polish: Ensure clean alignment within the right column. Use consistent spacing between the text/visual sections. Place the Sparq Skull footer logo correctly.

Reference: This revised layout aims for better structure and guarantees content fit by separating visuals and mandating text scaling. Align with sparq_deck_design_doc_v2. Replace the existing Slide 17 code.
