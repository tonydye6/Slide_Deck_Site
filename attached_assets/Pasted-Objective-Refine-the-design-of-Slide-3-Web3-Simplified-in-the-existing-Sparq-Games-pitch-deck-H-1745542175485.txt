Objective: Refine the design of Slide 3 ("Web3 Simplified") in the existing Sparq Games pitch deck HTML to improve clarity, visual structure, and alignment with the design document (sparq_deck_design_doc_v2) and INK Games inspiration.

Target: Slide 3 ("Web3 Simplified") of the HTML pitch deck.

Specific Refinement Instructions:

Layout & Structure:

Make the 3 columns for Web 1, Web 2, and Web 3 distinct visual blocks. Apply a background color (Steel #1E1E24 on Carbon #2B2842) or a prominent border (Outlaw Red #EB0028 or Grit Teal #00A19C) to each column container.

Ensure clear visual separation (e.g., adequate margin or a thin horizontal divider line in Grit Teal) between the 3-column comparison section and the market context paragraphs at the bottom.

Typography & Hierarchy:

Increase the size of the main "Web3 Simplified" title (ADAM.CG PRO, Grit Teal).

Use ADAM.CG PRO or Neodex for the "Web 1", "Web 2", "Web 3" column headings, making them stand out (consider using Outlaw Red or Grit Teal).

Ensure Inter font is used for all descriptive text and the market context paragraphs. Adjust sizing for readability.

Visual Elements & Icons:

Add simple, distinct line icons representing "Read", "Read-Write", and "Read-Write-Own" above the respective Web 1/2/3 column headings. Use Grit Teal or White for icon color.

Add visual arrow elements (e.g., ->) in Outlaw Red between the columns to indicate progression.

Ensure Logo_Skull(Red).png is used for bullet points within the column descriptions.

Color & Background:

Apply more brand colors as specified above (headings, borders, icons, arrows).

Consider changing the slide background from solid Carbon to a subtle gradient or add a very low-opacity (5-10%) abstract tech pattern overlay for visual interest.

Spacing & Polish:

Adjust padding within the column containers.

Ensure consistent margins between columns, text sections, and slide edges.

Refine text alignment and icon positioning.

Reference: Maintain consistency with the overall styles defined in sparq_deck_design_doc_v2.
