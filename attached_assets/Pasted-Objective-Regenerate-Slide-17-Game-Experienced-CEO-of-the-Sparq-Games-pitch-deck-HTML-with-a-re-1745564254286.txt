Objective: Regenerate Slide 17 ("Game Experienced CEO") of the Sparq Games pitch deck HTML with a revised two-column layout, integrating specific images and logos inline, and critically ensuring all content fits on the slide without overflow or scroll bars. Replace the previous version of Slide 17 entirely.

Target: Slide 17 ("Game Experienced CEO") of the HTML pitch deck.

Specific Instructions for New Design:

Background: Use a clean, dark background (Carbon #2B2842 or Steel #1E1E24). Do not use Jan_Nasdaq(Experienced_CEO_Slide).png as a full background watermark.

Layout: Implement a two-column layout (Left column ~30-35% width, Right column ~65-70% width). Ensure columns stack vertically on smaller screens.

Left Column (Headshot Only):

Place the primary headshot JanH_(Headshot).png prominently, potentially taking up most of the column height. Apply a clean style (e.g., subtle border). Keep this column otherwise empty.

Right Column (Titles, Text, Inline Images/Logos):

Place the main title "GAME EXPERIENCED CEO" (ADAM.CG PRO, Large, Uppercase, Grit Teal) and the name "JAN HORSFALL" (ADAM.CG PRO or Neodex, Medium-Large, White) at the top.

Structure the biographical text below, section by section:

Section 1 (Valvoline/Lycos): Add optional heading ("Early Career: Valvoline & Lycos" - ADAM.CG PRO/Neodex, Medium, Grit Teal). Add the relevant paragraph (Inter, Small-Medium, White). Integrate Valvoline_Logo.png (small) and Jan_Nasdaq(Experienced_CEO_Slide).png (resized significantly smaller, e.g., max-width 100-150px) directly adjacent to or within the flow of the text describing Lycos/Nasdaq.

Section 2 (Turbine): Add heading ("Turbine Games Turnaround" - ADAM.CG PRO/Neodex, Medium, Outlaw Red). Add the relevant paragraph (Inter, reduce font size to 13-14px if needed, use leading-snug). Integrate Turbine_Logo.png (small) and Lotro_Character.png (small, maybe opacity: 0.8) directly adjacent to or within the flow of the text describing Turbine/LOTRO.

Section 3 (CEO Roles): Add heading ("CEO Leadership" - ADAM.CG PRO/Neodex, Medium, Grit Teal). Add the relevant paragraph (Inter, Small-Medium, White). Integrate logos (Gemini Voice, Novo, Gelazzi, Big Freeze, Universal, PetroChoice, Warner Bros, NorthWestern Energy - use text/generic if files unavailable) inline with text or in a compact list/grid within this section.

Section 4 (MIT): Add heading ("AI & Strategy (MIT)" - ADAM.CG PRO/Neodex, Medium, Grit Teal). Add the relevant paragraph (Inter, Small-Medium, White). Integrate MIT logo (text/generic) inline.

Content Fit & Readability (CRITICAL):

Ensure ALL text content, inline images, and logos for Slide 17 are fully visible without overflowing or requiring scroll bars. This is the top priority.

Use text wrapping extensively in the right column.

Mandate font size reduction (min 12px) and tighter line spacing (leading-snug) for Inter description paragraphs as needed to fit content.

Ensure high contrast between text and the dark background.

Typography & Color: Strictly adhere to the font rules (ADAM.CG PRO, Inter, Neodex accents) and Sparq color palette (Outlaw Red, Grit Teal, Carbon, Steel, White) as defined in the main design document (sparq_deck_design_doc_v2).

Polish: Ensure clean alignment within the right column (especially between text and inline images/logos). Use consistent spacing between sections. Place the Sparq Skull footer logo correctly.

Reference: This revised layout prioritizes fitting all content by integrating secondary visuals inline and allowing for text scaling. Align with sparq_deck_design_doc_v2. Replace the existing Slide 17 code.
