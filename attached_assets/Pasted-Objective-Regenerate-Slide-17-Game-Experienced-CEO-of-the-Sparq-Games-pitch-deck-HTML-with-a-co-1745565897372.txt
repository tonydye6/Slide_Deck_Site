Objective: Regenerate Slide 17 ("Game Experienced CEO") of the Sparq Games pitch deck HTML with a completely new single-column, section-based layout. The primary goals are significantly improved visual structure, clear integration of all required elements, and absolute prevention of content overflow without scroll bars. Replace the previous version of Slide 17 entirely.

Target: Slide 17 ("Game Experienced CEO") of the HTML pitch deck.

Specific Instructions for New Design:

Background: Use a clean, dark background (Carbon #2B2842 or Steel #1E1E24).

Layout: Implement a single-column, full-width layout.

Header Section:

Place the main title "GAME EXPERIENCED CEO" (ADAM.CG PRO, Large, Uppercase, Grit Teal) at the top (centered or left-aligned).

Place the name "JAN HORSFALL" (ADAM.CG PRO or Neodex, Medium-Large, White) below the title.

Place the primary headshot JanH_(Headshot).png below the name, centered or left-aligned, with appropriate top margin. Apply a clean mask (circle/rounded square).

Content Sections (Vertical Flow below Header): Create distinct visual sections for each career phase using containers (e.g., padding: 1rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;) with top borders (border-top: 2px solid #00A19C; for Teal, #EB0028; for Red) or subtle background colors (background-color: #1E1E24;).

Section 1 (Valvoline/Lycos): Apply Grit Teal top border. Display the relevant paragraph (Inter, Small-Medium, White, leading-snug). Place Valvoline_Logo.png (small) and Jan_Nasdaq(Experienced_CEO_Slide).png (small, grayscale filter: grayscale(100%);) within this section, aligned neatly (e.g., below text or floated right).

Section 2 (Turbine): Apply Outlaw Red top border. Display the relevant paragraph (Inter, Mandatory 13px-14px font size AND leading-snug). Place Turbine_Logo.png (small) and Lotro_Character.png (small, opacity: 0.8) within this section, aligned neatly (e.g., below text or floated right).

Section 3 (CEO Roles): Apply Grit Teal top border. Display the relevant paragraph (Inter, Small-Medium, White). Below the text, create a compact 4x2 logo grid within this section for Gemini Voice, Novo, Gelazzi, Big Freeze, Universal, PetroChoice, Warner Bros, NorthWestern Energy (use text/generic if files unavailable). Keep logos small and uniform.

Section 4 (MIT): Apply Grit Teal top border. Display the relevant paragraph (Inter, Small-Medium, White). Place the MIT logo (text/generic) within this section, aligned neatly.

Content Fit & Readability (CRITICAL):

Ensure ALL text content, images, and logos for Slide 17 are fully visible without overflowing or requiring scroll bars. This is the highest priority.

Use text wrapping within the full width.

Mandatory: Use reduced font size (13px-14px, min 12px) and tight line spacing (leading-snug) for Inter description paragraphs as needed to fit content.

Ensure high contrast between text and the dark background.

Ensure adequate vertical spacing between the sections.

Typography & Color: Strictly adhere to the font rules (ADAM.CG PRO, Inter, Neodex accents) and Sparq color palette (Outlaw Red, Grit Teal, Carbon, Steel, White) as defined in the main design document (sparq_deck_design_doc_v2).

Polish: Ensure clean alignment within the column. Place the Sparq Skull footer logo correctly.

Reference: This new single-column layout focuses on vertical flow and clear sectioning to manage content density and prevent overflow. Align with sparq_deck_design_doc_v2. Replace the existing Slide 17 code
