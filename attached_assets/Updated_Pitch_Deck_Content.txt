﻿[Slide 3]: Web3 Simplified
Web3 is the next internet evolution where users own and control their digital assets, data, and online experiences
- Web 1: Read-only internet
o Consuming information
- Web 2: Read-write internet
o Creating content on platforms owned by big companies like Facebook and YouTube who take ownership of your content
- Web 3: Read-write-own internet
o You actually own your pieces of the digital world
Web3 represents a fundamental economic shift comparable to the rise of smartphones or e-commerce, creating trillions in market value as it transitions from early adopters to mainstream users.
Web3 is rewiring how ownership and value work in the digital realm, creating new markets and opportunities that extend far beyond cryptocurrencies.

﻿[Slide 4]: The Problem
Web3 must cross the adoption gap to unlock billions in massive economic value – beyond the current, paltry 5% Web3 penetration rate – by making it easier to understand and enjoy for the next generation of users
- Web3 blockchain market projected to reach $229B by 2034 (44.9% CAGR from 2024)
- Only 5% of total addressable market captured today because the industry has made it too complex
o 11 market points remain in Early Adopters segment
o 35 market points in untapped Early Majority
- Critical challenge: bridging the gap between tech-savvy early adopters and mainstream pragmatic users
[Chart showing market penetration rates with dollar values: $5.7B, $31B, $77B]
No fans in the stands! Penetration Rate

﻿[Slide 5]: Web3 Games Failed to Match Web2 Mobile Game Success
Web3 games have failed miserably to achieve the same level of mass user adoption and financial success as traditional Web2 mobile games
- High Startup Costs
o Web3 games cost too much for players versus F2P (free to play)
o Users need to purchase NFTs or tokens just to begin playing
- Speculation Focus
o Web3 games became speculation vehicles rather than entertainment
o The "play-to-earn" model prioritized financial returns over enjoyable gameplay, attracting investors rather than gamers
- Unsustainable Economics
o Web3 games relied on new player inflows to sustain their economies
o When growth slowed, token values collapsed, causing mass player exodus
- User Experience Problems
o Things like setting up crypto wallets, purchasing tokens, and understanding blockchain created friction for users accustomed to one-click app downloads
o Web3 games prioritized tokenomics over polished, engaging gameplay
- Technical Issues
o Blockchain limitations created problems with transaction speeds, gas fees, and overall performance that traditional games don't face
- Market and Design Challenges
o Misaligned incentives meant Web3 games struggle with balancing player economics, developer sustainability, and investor returns, creating fundamental economic design challenges
- Limited Target Audience
o The overlap between cryptocurrency enthusiasts and gamers is smaller than anticipated, limiting the potential user base
- Regulatory Uncertainty
o Concerns about gambling laws, securities regulations, and taxation have complicated the Web3 gaming landscape

﻿[Slide 6]: By Contrast, Mobile Gaming is Recession Proof
Mobile games have grown in popularity through every single economic cycle since inception
Mobile gaming is 2X the size of music and film combined and generates 53% of the total gaming category with a CAGR of 18.2% through 2032
- Consumer behavior consistently shows a flight to affordable digital entertainment in uncertain times, making mobile games a staple hobby whether the stock market is soaring or slumping
o The 2008 crisis proved that mobile games could thrive as cheap entertainment as other options faltered
o The 2020 COVID crash supercharged mobile gaming usage and revenue to unprecedented levels
o The current 2024 period finds mobile gaming usage high and widespread
- The mobile games industry has weathered any downturn with remarkable resilience, adapting to consumer needs and emerging even larger in audience size after each crisis

﻿[Slide 27]: Why Web3 Matters
Web3 isn't just about cryptocurrencies - it's about rewiring how value and ownership work in the digital world, creating opportunities similar to the early internet and mobile revolution
Web3 is the next evolution of the internet, designed to give you more control over your digital life.
- Web1 (1990s-2000s): Read-only internet. You visited websites to read.
- Web2 (2000s-present): Read-write internet. You can create content and interact (social media, YouTube), but companies own your data.
- Web3: Read-write-own internet. You own pieces of the internet through digital tokens, and no single company controls everything.
Imagine If You
- Owned your digital items the same way you own physical things
- Could vote on decisions for online services you use regularly
- Got paid when you create content without a platform taking a cut
- Kept control of your personal data instead of giving it away
The Value Creation Potential
- Digital Ownership Economy: Just like how smartphones created trillion-dollar companies by connecting everyone, Web3 creates a new economic layer where digital ownership can be proven, transferred, and valued
- Expanding Markets: The AI market is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by '30. Web3 creates similar potential by transforming how we handle digital value, reaching trillions in market value as it expands beyond early adopters to mainstream users.
- Real-World Comparison: When Amazon started, many couldn't grasp how online shopping would transform retail. Web3 represents a similar fundamental shift in how the internet works and creates value.

[Slide 31]: $Sparq Token Utility
$SPARQ TOKEN: NOT A GAMING TOKEN?
TOKEN UTILITY WITHOUT IN-GAME INTEGRATION
The $SPARQ token is not integrated directly into in-game economies, minimizing the risk of economic destabilization from token volatility. Allowing world class game designers to build stable in-game economies without counterparty risk of a volatile utility token, avoiding out-of-control inflation or deflation in-game, while leveraging the broader $SPARQ ecosystem.
Instead $SPARQ gains value from real revenue token buybacks, and is deflationary via token burns, and our sponsored game rewards marketplace.
A growing SPARQ user base will generate greater sponsorship revenue and brand deals for the Platform, creating a situation where MarketPlace rewards can be almost entirely covered by brand sponsors. This means that when $SPARQ rewards are spent on the MarketPlace, eventually the rewards never touch the underlying liquidity pool creating a major deflationary mechanic.
THE $SPARQ TOKEN IS A NATIVE YIELD, GOVERNANCE, & ECOSYSTEM REWARDS DEFLATIONARY TOKEN INTEGRATED INTO THE SPARQ INC. GAMING ECOSYSTEM.

[Slide 33]: Bitcoin Price After Halving
⚒️ What is Halving? → Happens every ~4 years, cuts new Bitcoin in half.
📦 Scarcity → Less Bitcoin available, often drives price up.
📈 Past Trends → 2012: $12 → $1,000 | 2016: $650 → $2,500 | 2020: $8,600 → $56,000.
🧠 Why? → Lower supply + same/higher demand + hype = price increase.
🔍 Bottom Line → Halving reduces supply. Historically followed by price jumps.

[Slide 35]: Risk & Mitigation Strategy
RiskMitigationGrant RFP under-deliversRun parallel negotiations with ≥3 chains; retain optionality to deploy on multi-chain; fallback to self-funded deployment if grant < target.Valuation skepticism (high raise in bear)Publish audited revenue + user KPIs; stage raise (strategic → community → public) to prove demand.Extended bear > Q2 2027Treasury runway 24 mo; option to delay TGE ≤ Q4 2027 while keeping chain bids warm.Reg-complianceUS accredited round; overseas retail via compliant launchpad; token designed for utility (marketplace credits & yield-share).
Bottom Line: A Q2 2027 TGE lets Sparq ride into the halving-led bull run with the largest active Web3 gaming audience, leverage chain-grant competition for 7-figure incentives, and maintain a full 24-month upside runway before the expected 2029 peak—while showcasing disciplined, data-driven timing to institutional investors.

[Slide 36]: Deflationary Core
Powered by Sponsors
Sponsored by sports leagues, Fortune 500 ad networks, and local businesses—not token liquidity. This means:

Little pressure on the token's liquidity pool
Spent tokens can be burned, making $SPARQ deflationary
Rewards are still delivered via external partners

Revenue-Driven Buybacks
Tokens are distributed to gamers through a revenue-funded buyback program with an initial burn, creating a closed loop of value where real users, utility and deflation feed growth.
GAMERS SPEND $SPARQ TOKENS IN A MARKETPLACE FILLED WITH REAL-WORLD AND DIGITAL REWARDS— BRAND DEALS, MERCH, RAFFLES, TICKETS, COLLECTIBLES, SUBSCRIPTIONS AND MORE.
