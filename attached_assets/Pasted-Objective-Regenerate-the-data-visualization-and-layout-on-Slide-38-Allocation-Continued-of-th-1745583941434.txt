Objective: Regenerate the data visualization and layout on Slide 38 ("Allocation [Continued]") of the Sparq Games pitch deck HTML to accurately represent the source stacked bar chart provided in slide38_Replit_Output_and_Source_Chart.pdf using a two-column layout. Replace the existing incorrect chart and layout entirely.

Target: Slide 38 ("Allocation [Continued]").

Specific Instructions:

Remove Existing Chart & Layout: Delete the current incorrect chart visualization code and any previous layout structure for this slide's main content area.

Implement Two-Column Layout: Create a main content area below the title/subtitle that is split into two columns (e.g., using Flexbox or Grid).

Left Column (approx. 35-40% width): Legend & Text

Right Column (approx. 60-65% width): Chart Visualization

Left Column Content:

Legend: Create a clear legend listing all 8 allocation categories (Token Sale, Team, Partners, Marketing, NFT Holders, Ecosystem, Liquidity, Foundation).

Layout: Arrange the legend items compactly to save vertical space, ideally in a two-column grid (4x2) within this left column.

Styling: For each item, show a small color swatch matching the color used in the chart for that category, followed by the category name. Use 'Inter' font for the legend text (small size). Ensure colors are accurate.

Descriptive Text: Below the legend block, place the descriptive paragraph: "The $SPARQ token release is strategically phased... sustainable earning opportunities." Use 'Inter' font, ensure it wraps correctly, and adjust font size (min 12px) and line spacing (leading-snug) as needed to fit within the remaining space in this column.

Right Column Content:

Implement New Chart - Stacked Bar Chart:

Type: Create a Stacked Bar Chart. Do NOT use a stacked area chart.

Data Points (Bars): Create bars corresponding to the weeks shown in the source chart's X-axis (0, 3, 6, 9, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60).

Data Series & Stacking Order: Each bar must be composed of stacked segments representing the allocation categories. The stacking order (bottom to top) MUST match the source legend:

Token Sale

Team

Partners

Marketing

NFT Holders

Ecosystem

Liquidity

Foundation

Segment Heights: The height of each colored segment within each bar must visually approximate the proportions shown in the source chart image for that specific week. Estimate these proportions carefully from the source image. The total height of each bar should reflect the cumulative total at that week, reaching 1,000,000,000 at week 60.

Colors: Assign distinct Sparq brand colors to each category (e.g., Token Sale: #00A19C, Team: #EB0028, Partners: #FF3864, Marketing: #404BF2, NFT Holders: #FFD700, Ecosystem: #A0522D (SaddleBrown - adjust if needed), Liquidity: #C0F2EA, Foundation: #DAA520 (Goldenrod - adjust if needed)). Ensure the chosen colors are used consistently in the chart segments and match the legend in the left column.

Axes:

X-axis: Label "Weeks", include markers for 0, 3, 6, 9, 24, ..., 60.

Y-axis: Label "Finite Token Supply", include markers from 0 to 1,000,000,000 (e.g., 0, 200M, 400M, 600M, 800M, 1B).

Use 'Inter' font for axis labels.

Legend: Do NOT place a legend directly below the chart in this column (it's in the left column).

Implementation Method: If possible, use a JavaScript charting library (like Chart.js or D3.js) configured to produce this specific stacked bar chart. If a library cannot be used, construct the chart using HTML div elements. Each bar would be a container div, and each segment within the bar would be an inner div with a specific height (calculated based on the estimated proportion and total bar height) and the correct background-color. Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout. Ensure the chart fills the available space in the right column appropriately.

Content Fit (CRITICAL): Ensure the entire slide content (title, subtitle, legend, text, chart) fits within the slide boundaries without any overflow or requiring scroll bars. Adjust chart size, text size (min 12px), or spacing slightly if absolutely necessary, prioritizing the visibility of all elements. Ensure the two columns align vertically if possible (e.g., using Flexbox align-items: stretch).

Reference: The final chart must visually match the structure, data representation, and categories shown in the source chart image from slide38_Replit_Output_and_Source_Chart.pdf. The overall slide layout should now be two columns. Align other styling with sparq_deck_design_doc_v2. Replace the existing chart and layout code on Slide 38.
