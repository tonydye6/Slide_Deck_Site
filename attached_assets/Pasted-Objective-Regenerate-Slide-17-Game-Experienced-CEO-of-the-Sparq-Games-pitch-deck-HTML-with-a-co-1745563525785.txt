Objective: Regenerate Slide 17 ("Game Experienced CEO") of the Sparq Games pitch deck HTML with a completely new, professional two-column layout. Ensure all content fits without overflow and incorporate the specified background image treatment. Replace the previous version of Slide 17 entirely.

Target: Slide 17 ("Game Experienced CEO") of the HTML pitch deck.

Specific Instructions for New Design:

Background:

Set the base background to Carbon #2B2842 or a similar dark tone.

Apply the Jan_Nasdaq(Experienced_CEO_Slide).png image (from Headshots_Grid.pdf) as a full-slide background watermark. Style it with low opacity (e.g., opacity: 0.1 or opacity: 0.15), desaturate it (filter: grayscale(100%);), and ensure it sits behind all other content (z-index: -1; if needed).

Layout: Implement a two-column layout (e.g., Left column ~35-40% width, Right column ~60-65% width). Ensure columns stack vertically on smaller screens.

Left Column (Image & Logos):

Place the primary headshot JanH_(Headshot).png prominently at the top. Apply a clean style (e.g., slight border or mask).

Below the headshot, create a distinct section/container (e.g., background-color: #1E1E24; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 8px;).

Inside this container, display the associated company logos (Valvoline, Lycos, Turbine, Warner Bros, Gemini Voice, Novo Networks, Gelazzi, Big Freeze, Universal Energy, PetroChoice, NorthWestern Energy, MIT - use text or generic logos if specific files unavailable) in a neat grid or vertical list. Keep logos relatively small and consistently styled (e.g., grayscale or white).

Right Column (Titles & Text):

Place the main title "GAME EXPERIENCED CEO" (ADAM.CG PRO, Large, Uppercase, Grit Teal) and the name "JAN HORSFALL" (ADAM.CG PRO or Neodex, Medium-Large, White) at the top.

Structure the biographical text below using clear headings for distinct sections (e.g., "Valvoline & Lycos", "Turbine Games Turnaround", "CEO Leadership", "AI & Strategy (MIT)"). Use ADAM.CG PRO or Neodex (Medium, Outlaw Red or Grit Teal) for these headings.

Use Inter font (Small-Medium, White) for the paragraphs under each heading.

Content Fit & Readability (CRITICAL):

Ensure ALL text content from Updated_Pitch_Deck_Content.txt for Slide 17 is included and fully visible without overflowing or requiring scroll bars.

Ensure text in the right column wraps correctly.

Adjust the font size for the Inter description text if necessary (minimum 12-14px) to make it fit.

Ensure high contrast between text and the background/watermark.

Typography & Color: Strictly adhere to the font rules (ADAM.CG PRO, Inter, Neodex accents) and Sparq color palette (Outlaw Red, Grit Teal, Carbon, Steel, White) as defined in the main design document (sparq_deck_design_doc_v2).

Polish: Ensure clean alignment, consistent spacing, and proper placement of the Sparq Skull footer logo.

Reference: This new layout should be more professional and visually balanced, ensuring all content is readable and fits on the slide. Align with sparq_deck_design_doc_v2. Replace the existing Slide 17 code.
