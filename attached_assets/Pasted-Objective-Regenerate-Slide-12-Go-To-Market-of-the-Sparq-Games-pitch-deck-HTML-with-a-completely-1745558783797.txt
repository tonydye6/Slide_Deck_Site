Objective: Regenerate Slide 12 ("Go To Market") of the Sparq Games pitch deck HTML with a completely new, dynamic "Angled Flow Grid" layout inspired by the INK Games deck. Ensure all content fits without overflow. Replace the previous version of Slide 12 entirely.

Target: Slide 12 ("Go To Market") of the HTML pitch deck.

Specific Instructions for New Design:

Background: Apply Gameplay1.png (from Support_Images_Grid.pdf) as the background image with a dark overlay (Carbon #2B2842 at 85-90% opacity) ensuring text readability.

Top Section:

Place the main title "GO TO MARKET" (ADAM.CG PRO, Large, Uppercase, Grit Teal) at the top.

Place the introductory paragraph ("AAA IP mobile sports games...") below the title, spanning the width (Inter, Medium, White).

Component Grid (Angled Flow):

Layout: Arrange the 6 strategy components (Premium Sports IP, Team + AI, Proprietary Engine, Sparq Locker Room, Community Growth, Tokenomics) in a flexible 2x3 grid below the intro text (e.g., use Tailwind: grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6).

Containers: Style each grid item as a distinct visual container. Use parallelograms or rectangles with angled top/bottom edges. Apply a subtle background (Steel #1E1E24) or a border (Outlaw Red or Grit Teal). Ensure consistent angling/style.

Flow Indicators: Add subtle, stylized arrows (e.g., chevrons in Outlaw Red) between containers if possible to suggest a logical flow (e.g., top-left to bottom-right).

Content within Containers:

Icon: Place a specific, simple line icon for each component (Trophy, Brain+Team, Engine/Cog, Locker, People Network, Token) inside its container (top-left or above title). Use Grit Teal or White for icons.

Title: Display the component title (e.g., "PREMIUM SPORTS IP PORTFOLIO") using ADAM.CG PRO or Neodex (Medium, White or Grit Teal).

Description: Display the descriptive text using Inter font (Small-Medium, White). Use the custom bullet attached_assets/Bulletpoint_Logo_Skull(Red) copy.png for first-level list items within descriptions (ensure CSS from previous prompt is applied or re-apply if needed). Use standard nested bullets (disc/square) for deeper levels.

Content Fit & Responsiveness (CRITICAL):

Ensure all text, including nested bullets, is fully visible within its container without overflowing.

Containers must resize vertically to accommodate their content.

Use flexible layouts and text wrapping.

If necessary to prevent overflow, slightly reduce the font size of the Inter description text (minimum 12px).

Typography & Color: Strictly adhere to the font rules (ADAM.CG PRO, Inter, Neodex accents) and Sparq color palette as defined in the main design document (sparq_deck_design_doc_v2).

Polish: Ensure clean alignment, consistent spacing between grid items, and proper placement of the Sparq Skull footer logo.

Reference: This new layout should be significantly more dynamic and visually structured than the previous version, drawing inspiration from the INK Games deck's energy while ensuring all content from Updated_Pitch_Deck_Content.txt for Slide 12 is included and readable. Replace the existing Slide 12 code.
